## What is Source?

Source is a game engine created by Valve Software for Half-Life 2. It is the successor of GoldSRC, made for the first Half-Life.

## What are "Source Mods"?

*Source Mods* are games made with the Source engine, by the community, that needs another game in order to be playable. Some cases are ambiguous whether they are Source games or Source mods, as they are not directly mods for a particular game, but for the *Source SDK Base*(more often on the 2013 edition). Keep in mind that if it's paid, on Steam, it's a game!

## Where is this *"sourcemod" path* mentionned in the settings?

If you're completely new to modding Valve games, I shall explain what the hell is this mysterious ***sourcemod*** folder. Steam(yeah you need Steam, duh) groups all downloaded apps in a folder called "***steamapps***", so it know that the game is installed somewhere. It is possible to have multiple ***steamapps*** folder, but the one that really matters is the one ***directly besides your STEAM.EXE file***, as it is the main one. In this folder, you will see multiple things, including our glorious ***sourcemods*** folder. Put the path of your folder that contains your ***Steam.exe***, then add:
```
/steamapps/sourcemods
```
